# Ci Design System

The Ci palette is implemented as CSS variables in `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css` and is consumed by the SPA via Tailwind classes.

- **Ci Sky (#63B3F5)**: background accents and gradients
- **Ci Wave (#32B4F2)**: active elements and connectors
- **Ci Deep (#07324F)**: depth and typography
- **Ci Glow (#FFD978)**: highlights and halos

Motion uses Framer Motion with slow, repeating keyframes to communicate breathing resonance across modules.
